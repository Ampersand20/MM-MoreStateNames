### FRANCE ###
POLITICS_FRA_VAN_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was a prominent French communist during the Interwar period and was a leader of the French Communist Party. Born in 1900 in Noyelles-Godault, Picardy, he joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1920. He quickly rose through the ranks of the PCF, becoming leader of the party in 1930, which he would be until his death.\n\nIn 1934, Thorez helped establish the Popular Front in France, a coalition that won the 1936 Election, putting the PCF in government until 1938. During WWII, he would be in Moscow. In France, Jacques Duclos, Thorez's right-hand man, encouraged members to fight the German occupation, a move that would popularize the party after the war.\n\nIn November 1944, a few months after the Liberation of Paris, Thorez would return after his 4-year exile in Moscow. In the years between WWII and the Cold War, the PCF would be a popular party in France, mainly due to its role in the French Resistance. In the 1945 Election, a reformed Popular Front won, making Thorez Vice Premier. However, this government would again collapse in 1947 due to rising pressure from the Americans to purge communists from the government. He retained his leadership until he died in 1964.\n\nBut what if this happened differently? If the communists managed to seize power after WWII, and the May Crises of '47 never affected France? Or things could've proceeded differently in the '30s, and Thorez could have absolute control of France. Go wild, since the choice is yours."
POLITICS_FRA_COM_DESC:0 "Marceau Pivert was a French communist during the Interwar Period and into the Cold War. Born in Montmachoux, a tiny Commune in Southeastern Paris in 1895, he was a veteran of World War I, turning him into a staunch pacifist. \n\nHe joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) after the war, and was one of the most left-wing members of the party. In the 1930s, he began organizing the most radical members of the party into the 'Revolutionary Left' faction. \n\nThe faction would soon come to be at odds with the SFIO, especially after the SFIO became part of the French Government in 1936, and Léon Blum became Prime Minister. The divides became so deep that Pivert and his faction left the SFIO and established their own party, the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (PSOP). \n\nIn 1940, after the Fall of France, the PSOP was banned, and Pivert went into exile in Mexico. After the end of his exile, he found that his party had been divided, and most have joined the PCF, or rejoined the SFIO, like he would do. Despite Pivert becoming more moderate within the SFIO, and being popular within the party, being elected to roles of party leadership several times, Pivert still had major disagreements with the SFIO, and eventually was voted out of leadership. He died in 1958."
POLITICS_FRA_SOCREP_DESC:0 "Léon Blum was a prominent French Socialist during the Interwar Period, and also during the early years of the French Fourth Republic. Born in Paris in 1872 to a Jewish middle-class family, he showed little interest in politics as a child, until the Dreyfus Affair in 1894, which exposed a systemic racism against Jews in French society, sparking a nationwide controversy. \n\nAs a Jew himself, Blum was a very outspoken Dreyfusard, which brought him into contact with Jean Jaurès, a prominent socialist, and a member of the French Section of the Worker's International (SFIO), whom Blum greatly admired. He began contributing to L'Humanité, a French socialist newspaper. \n\nAfter Jaurès was assassinated in 1914, he became very involved in the SFIO, and after the First World War in 1919, was elected as a chair of the party's executive committee. In 1920, due to rising disagreements over the Russian Revolution, with the mainstream SFIO denouncing the revolutionaries, the more radical members split off, forming the PCF, taking L'Humanité with them. Due to L'Humanité being with the PCF, Blum started writing for a new socialist paper, called Le Populaire. Despite initially opposing Stalin and radical communism, Blum eventually softened towards them, mainly due to the rise of fascism. \n\nIn 1935, the Popular Front was formed between the SFIO, the Communist Party of France (PCF), and other leftist parties, and in 1936, they managed to form a government, and Blum became Prime Minister, making him the first socialist and Jew to hold the position. Despite the early sucess of the government, issues soon arose. The Spanish Civil War deeply divided the party, which led Blum to resign in 1937. He was Prime Minister again briefly in 1938, but not much occured, and the Popular Front quickly collapsed. \n\nAfter the German invasion of France, Blum made no attempt to free, despite severe risks, with him being both a socialist and Jew. This ended up happening, as he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp, but he survived until the end of the war. \n\nAfter the war, he returned to politics briefly, and was Prime Minister again, during a brief interim government. He would continue to be involved in politics, and would continue to write for Le Populaire until his death in 1950."
POLITICS_FRA_SOCMON_DESC:0 "Jean d'Orléans was the Duke of Guise and the Orléanist claimant to the French throne. Born in 1874 in Paris, 26 years after Louis Phillipe I, great-grandfather, was deposed. \n\nUnlike many other former monarchs, Jean III's life was largely irrelevant, compared to the other Legitimist and Bonapartist claimants. After the death of his cousin Phillipe in 1926, he became the Orléanist claimant to the French throne. \n\nAs his claim to the throne was esentially a meaningless title that wasn't taken seriously, he was not very involved in French politics, and lived a rather quiet life, having 4 children. \n\nIn 1940, after the Germans invaded France, Jean fled France, and came to Morocco, where he died a few months later."
POLITICS_FRA_LIBREP_DESC:0 "Édouard Daladier was the Prime Minister of France during the outbreak of World War II. Born in Carpentras, a small town in Provence in 1884, he was educated in Lyon. \n\nAfter he graduated, he returned to his hometown to become Mayor of Carpentras in 1912. He ran to join the Chamber of Deputies, but lost to the Radical-Socialist Party, a party which he would later join. \n\nWhen World War I broke out, he was drafted into the French Army. During the war, he fought at the Battle of Verdun, and was promoted to Captain. After the war, he returned to his political career in 1919, and entered the Chamber of Deputies, and would join the Radical-Socialist party, the party he previously lost to in 1912. \n\nDaladier served in several governmental positions during the Interwar period, and would be very helpful in negotiating with the French Section of the Worker's International (SFIO). In 1933, he would become Prime Minister, but his government collapsed nine months later. However, in the wake of the Stavisky Affair, a major corruption scandal in the French government, Daladier was able to take power again, although the government fell two months later because of the February 6 Riots, right-wing riots that brought down Daladier's government. \n\nAfter withdrawing from politics for a year, Daladier returned, and turning to populism against the banks, his party and the Popular Front managed to form a government. However, due to major disagreements about a stance in the Spanish Civil War, the coalition collapsed, and Daladier took power, and would be Prime Minister until the German invasion. \n\nThe first major challenge for Daladier's government was the Munich Agreement. While Daladier initially wanted to defend Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain reaching an agreement with Hitler meant that France would have to face Germany on its own, which would be crippling or the country. Therefore, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, and later the whole of the country a few months later. After the outbreak of World War II, Daladier was Prime Minister during the Phony War, but resigned in March of 1940 due to his failure to defend Finland. He was replaced by Paul Reynaud, who would be Prime Minister until the Fall of France. \n\nAfter Paris fell to the Germans, Daladier fled to Morocco, but was captured by Vichy authorities, and was convicted of treason, and then imprisoned until 1945, when he was liberated by American soldiers, after a brief scuffle with the SS. \n\nHe returned to politics briefly, and held a position in the Chamber of Deputies, and became Mayor of Avignon in 1953. After that, he retired from politics, and died in 1970 at the age of 86."

Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid.\n\nThe emperor penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66° and 77° south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to 18km offshore."

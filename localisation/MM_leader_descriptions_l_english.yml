### FRANCE ###
POLITICS_FRA_VAN_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was one of the most famous French communists during the Interwar Period, and for 34 years, leader of the French Communist Party. Born in 1900 in Noyelles-Godault, a small town in Picardy, he became a coal miner at the age of 12. \n\nIn 1919, he joined the French Section of the Worker's International (SFIO), and the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1920, when it split off from the SFIO. He quickly rose through the ranks of the PCF, becoming party secretary in 1923, and then secretary-general of the party in 1930, a position he would hold until his death. \n\nFollowing a directive by the Communist International in 1934, Thorez played a key role in the establishment of the Popular Front in France, a broad coalition of leftist parties that managed to edge a narrow victory against the right in the 1936 French Election, putting the PCF in the French Government for the first time. However, the Popular Front would eventually collapse in 1938, due to disagreement over foreign policy involving Germany. \n\nWith the German invasion of Poland and the onset of the Second World War, the PCF was banned due to its staunch anti-war stance. During the war, he would live in Moscow, and he would come to know Joseph Stalin. In France, Jacques Duclos, Thorez's right-hand-man, encouraged members to fight the German occupation, and helped organize strikes and other means of making the occupation more difficult for the Wehrmacht. \n\nIn November 1944, a few months after the Liberation of Paris, Thorez would return home, after his 4 year long exile in Moscow. In the years between the end of World War II and the Cold War, the PCF would be the most popular party in France, mainly due to its role in the French Resistance. In the 1945 Election, a new Popular Front is formed, winning a staggering 75% of the vote, and Thorez became Vice Premier. However, this government would again collapse in 1947, due to instability, and rising pressure from the American Embassy to kick the Communists out of government. The looming disaster occured in the May 1947 Crisis, which resulted in the PCF being ejected from the government, and it would be the last time they would be in a government until the fall of the Fourth Republic in 1958. \n\nIn 1950, Thorez would suffer from a stroke, and would be recovering in the Soviet Union until 1953. During that time, Duclos would be de-facto head of the PCF. Upon his return in 1953, he retained his role of party leader, despite his deteriorating health. He would be secretary-general of the PCF until his death on a Black Sea Cruise in 1964, at the age of 64."
POLITICS_FRA_COM_DESC:0 "Marceau Pivert was a French communist during the Interwar Period and into the Cold War. Born in Montmachoux, a tiny Commune in Southeastern Paris in 1895, he was a veteran of World War I, turning him into a staunch pacifist. \n\nHe joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) after the war, and was one of the most left-wing members of the party. In the 1930s, he began organizing the most radical members of the party into the 'Revolutionary Left' faction. \n\nThe faction would soon come to be at odds with the SFIO, especially after the SFIO became part of the French Government in 1936, and Léon Blum became Prime Minister. The divides became so deep that Pivert and his faction left the SFIO and established their own party, the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (PSOP). \n\nIn 1940, after the Fall of France, the PSOP was banned, and Pivert went into exile in Mexico. After the end of his exile, he found that his party had been divided, and most have joined the PCF, or rejoined the SFIO, like he would do. Despite Pivert becoming more moderate within the SFIO, and being popular within the party, being elected to roles of party leadership several times, Pivert still had major disagreements with the SFIO, and eventually was voted out of leadership. He died in 1958."
POLITICS_FRA_SOCREP_DESC:0 "Léon Blum was a prominent French Socialist during the Interwar Period, and also during the early years of the French Fourth Republic. Born in Paris in 1872 to a Jewish middle-class family, he showed little interest in politics as a child, until the Dreyfus Affair in 1894, which exposed a systemic racism against Jews in French society, sparking a nationwide controversy. \n\nAs a Jew himself, Blum was a very outspoken Dreyfusard, which brought him into contact with Jean Jaurès, a prominent socialist, and a member of the French Section of the Worker's International (SFIO), whom Blum greatly admired. He began contributing to L'Humanité, a French socialist newspaper. \n\nAfter Jaurès was assassinated in 1914, he became very involved in the SFIO, and after the First World War in 1919, was elected as a chair of the party's executive committee. In 1920, due to rising disagreements over the Russian Revolution, with the mainstream SFIO denouncing the revolutionaries, the more radical members split off, forming the PCF, taking L'Humanité with them. Due to L'Humanité being with the PCF, Blum started writing for a new socialist paper, called Le Populaire. Despite initially opposing Stalin and radical communism, Blum eventually softened towards them, mainly due to the rise of fascism. \n\nIn 1935, the Popular Front was formed between the SFIO, the Communist Party of France (PCF), and other leftist parties, and in 1936, they managed to form a government, and Blum became Prime Minister, making him the first socialist and Jew to hold the position. Despite the early sucess of the government, issues soon arose. The Spanish Civil War deeply divided the party, which led Blum to resign in 1937. He was Prime Minister again briefly in 1938, but not much occured, and the Popular Front quickly collapsed. \n\nAfter the German invasion of France, Blum made no attempt to free, despite severe risks, with him being both a socialist and Jew. This ended up happening, as he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp, but he survived until the end of the war. \n\nAfter the war, he returned to politics briefly, and was Prime Minister again, during a brief interim government. He would continue to be involved in politics, and would continue to write for Le Populaire until his death in 1950."

Its diet consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as krill, and cephalopods, such as squid.\n\nThe emperor penguin has a circumpolar distribution in the Antarctic almost exclusively between the 66° and 77° south latitudes. It almost always breeds on stable pack ice near the coast and up to 18km offshore."

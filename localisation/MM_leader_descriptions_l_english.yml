### FRANCE ###
POLITICS_FRA_VAN_DESC:0 "Maurice Thorez was a prominent French communist during the Interwar period and was a leader of the French Communist Party. Born in 1900 in Noyelles-Godault, Picardy, he joined the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO), but joined the French Communist Party (PCF) in 1920 when it split off. He quickly rose through the ranks of the PCF, becoming leader of the party in 1930, which he would be until his death.\n\nIn 1934, Thorez helped establish the Popular Front in France, a coalition that won the 1936 Election, putting the PCF in government until 1938, when the Front collapsed over conflicted opinions with the Munich agreement. During WWII, he would be in Moscow. In France, Jacques Duclos, Thorez's right-hand man, encouraged members to fight the German occupation, a move that would popularize the party after the war.\n\nIn November 1944, a few months after the Liberation of Paris, Thorez would return after his 4-year exile in Moscow. In the years between WWII and the Cold War, the PCF would be a popular party in France, mainly due to its role in the French Resistance. In the 1945 Election, a reformed Popular Front won, making Thorez Vice Premier. However, this government would again collapse in 1947 due to rising pressure from the Americans to kick out the communists from government, which happened, causing the May Crisis. He retained his leadership until he died in 1964.\n\nBut what if this happened differently? If the communists managed to seize power after WWII, and the May Crises of '47 never affected France? Or things could've proceeded differently in the '30s, and Thorez could have absolute control of France. Go wild, for the choice is yours."
POLITICS_FRA_COM_DESC:0 "Marceau Pivert was a French communist during the Interwar Period and into the Cold War. Born 1895 in Montmachoux, Paris, he was a soldier during WWI, which made him a staunch pacifist. After WWI, he became a teacher until 1939. Outside his political party, he was an active member of many unions, including the National Union of Teachers (SNI) and the General Confederation of Workers (CGT).\n\nHe joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO) in 1924 and was very radical compared to other members. In the 1930s, he began organizing the most radical members of the party into the 'Revolutionary Left' faction. The faction would soon come to be at odds with the SFIO, especially after the SFIO became part of the French Government in 1936 and Léon Blum became Prime Minister. The divides became so deep that Pivert and his faction left the SFIO and established their party, the Workers and Peasants' Socialist Party (PSOP).\n\nIn 1940, after the Fall of France, Phillipe Pétain banned and dissolved the PSOP, causing Pivert to flee to Mexico. After the war, most of the party, including himself, rejoined the SFIO, while some joined the French Communist Party (PCF), which had grown significantly from the war. Despite making amends with the SFIO, he disagreed with them frequently, most notably his stance on the Algerian War, where he supported Algerian independence, going against the vast majority of the party. He died in 1958.\n\nUltimately, Marceau Pivert never had much of an impact on French politics. What if that was different? What if Marceau Pivert and the PSOP became popular? Maybe worked with the PCF, or maybe even merged with it, seizing power in France? Go wild, for the choice is yours."
POLITICS_FRA_SOCREP_DESC:0 "Léon Blum was a prominent French Socialist during the Interwar Period and the beginning of the Cold War. Born in 1872 in Paris to a middle-class Jewish family, Blum was uninterested in politics as a child. However, the Dreyfus Affair in 1894 exposed systemic racism against Jews in French society, sparking a nationwide controversy.\n\nIn 1914, Jean Jaurès, a mentor and idol for Blum, was assassinated. Blum became involved in the French Section of the Worker's Internationale (SFIO) SFIO and became chair of the party's executive committee in 1919. In 1920, the French Communist Party (PCF) split from the SFIO due to disagreements on the Russian Revolution. Despite initially opposing the Soviets and communism, Blum eventually softened towards them, mainly due to the rise of fascism.\n\nIn 1935, the Popular Front was formed between the SFIO, the PCF, and other leftist parties, and in 1936, they managed to form a government, making Blum Prime Minister. Despite the early success of the government, issues soon arose. The Spanish Civil War deeply divided the party, which led Blum to resign in 1937. He was Prime Minister again briefly in 1938, but the Popular Front quickly collapsed due to disagreements on stance towards the Munich Agreement. After the German invasion of France, Blum did not attempt to free, despite severe risks, with him being both a socialist and Jew. The fear was confirmed, as he was arrested and sent to a concentration camp, but he survived.\n\nAfter the war, Blum returned to politics and was Prime Minister again during a brief interim government. He would continue to be involved in politics until he died in 1950. Blum played a role in French politics during the 1930s but fell short due to instability in his government. However, what if he steered his party steadily during those hard times? What if the Popular Front ruled France for most of the Interwar period? Go wild, for the choice is yours."
POLITICS_FRA_SOCMON_DESC:0 "Jean d'Orléans was the Duke of Guise and the Orléanist claimant to the French throne. Born in 1874 in Paris, 26 years after Louis Phillipe I, great-grandfather, was deposed. \n\nUnlike many other former monarchs, Jean III's life was largely irrelevant, compared to the other Legitimist and Bonapartist claimants. After the death of his cousin Phillipe in 1926, he became the Orléanist claimant to the French throne. \n\nAs his claim to the throne was esentially a meaningless title that wasn't taken seriously, he was not very involved in French politics, and lived a rather quiet life, having 4 children. \n\nIn 1940, after the Germans invaded France, Jean fled France, and came to Morocco, where he died a few months later."
POLITICS_FRA_LIBREP_DESC:0 "Édouard Daladier was the Prime Minister of France during the outbreak of World War II. Born in Carpentras, a small town in Provence in 1884, he was educated in Lyon. \n\nAfter he graduated, he returned to his hometown to become Mayor of Carpentras in 1912. He ran to join the Chamber of Deputies, but lost to the Radical-Socialist Party, a party which he would later join. \n\nWhen World War I broke out, he was drafted into the French Army. During the war, he fought at the Battle of Verdun, and was promoted to Captain. After the war, he returned to his political career in 1919, and entered the Chamber of Deputies, and would join the Radical-Socialist party, the party he previously lost to in 1912. \n\nDaladier served in several governmental positions during the Interwar period, and would be very helpful in negotiating with the French Section of the Worker's International (SFIO). In 1933, he would become Prime Minister, but his government collapsed nine months later. However, in the wake of the Stavisky Affair, a major corruption scandal in the French government, Daladier was able to take power again, although the government fell two months later because of the February 6 Riots, right-wing riots that brought down Daladier's government. \n\nAfter withdrawing from politics for a year, Daladier returned, and turning to populism against the banks, his party and the Popular Front managed to form a government. However, due to major disagreements about a stance in the Spanish Civil War, the coalition collapsed, and Daladier took power, and would be Prime Minister until the German invasion. \n\nThe first major challenge for Daladier's government was the Munich Agreement. While Daladier initially wanted to defend Czechoslovakia, Chamberlain reaching an agreement with Hitler meant that France would have to face Germany on its own, which would be crippling or the country. Therefore, Germany annexed the Sudetenland, and later the whole of the country a few months later. After the outbreak of World War II, Daladier was Prime Minister during the Phony War, but resigned in March of 1940 due to his failure to defend Finland. He was replaced by Paul Reynaud, who would be Prime Minister until the Fall of France. \n\nAfter Paris fell to the Germans, Daladier fled to Morocco, but was captured by Vichy authorities, and was convicted of treason, and then imprisoned until 1945, when he was liberated by American soldiers, after a brief scuffle with the SS. \n\nHe returned to politics briefly, and held a position in the Chamber of Deputies, and became Mayor of Avignon in 1953. After that, he retired from politics, and died in 1970 at the age of 86."
